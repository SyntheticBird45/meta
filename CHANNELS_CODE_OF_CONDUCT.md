# The Monero Project's Matrix & IRC Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We - as contributors to, maintainers of, and participants in The Monero Project -
pledge not to act disruptively, inappropriately, or with bad intent against other
participants in our Matrix/IRC communities.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within The Monero Project's Matrix and Libera IRC channels, 
which will be referred to as "community spaces" for the rest of the document.

This document intends to formalize basic conditions and guidelines toward the goal of 
fostering a healthy and flourishing community. It does so by clearly defining limits and 
responsibilities for both moderators and participants, as well as providing frameworks for 
both their enforcement and the contestation of enforcement.

This document **DOES NOT** intend to decree or mandate the political or social atmosphere 
within community spaces. The Monero community is rich, and you'll always find dissident 
opinions. As long as we all respect the standards outlined below, all opinions are allowed 
to be said in their appropriate channels. Online political discussions nearly never end well, 
and as such participants are encouraged to be careful when engaging in such discourse.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to being a good participant in community spaces:

* Being empathetic and kind towards other people, especially newcomers.
* Being respectful of different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Accepting constructive feedback and taking responsibilty for one's own actions.
* Apologizing to those affected by our actions when they violate our standards. 
* Respecting each channel's intended function and purpose.

Examples of behaviors disruptive and inappropriate to community spaces include:

* Discussing or sharing any content of a sexual nature in primary channels.
* Persistently trolling and spamming, specifically to the point it disrupts the channel.
* Harassing and/or griefing other participants for any reason.
* Doxxing, impersonating, scamming, or stalking participants in or out of the channel.

Some of these unacceptable behaviors have different severity levels according to the context 
and channel. Some channels are more lenient or strict than others, and indicate as much to participants.
Discretion as to the leniency or strictness is left to the moderations, operating within this framework.

More generally, this list of bad behaviors clarifies the definition of a bad actor provided in 
the CONTRIBUTING policy of The Monero Project:

> A bad actor is someone who repeatedly ignores the rules and culture of the project, who is 
needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who is offensive, and who is unable to self-correct their 
behavior when asked to do so by others.

## Community moderators

Community moderators are sets of individuals in the community spaces who have 
moderation capabilities and have volunteered themselves to contribute to this end.

- On Matrix, community moderators have the "Moderator" role. They are able to use the 
"banhammer" (or equivalent) bot account to take actions.
- On IRC, community moderators have the "+o" (Owner) mode. They are able to use several 
IRC commands to take actions. Be aware, not all Owners +o members are community moderators.

### Becoming or removing a moderator

Each group of moderators is managed by itself. New moderators are added at the existing 
moderators' discretion. Existing moderators can be removed if petitioned by the community, 
also at the moderators' discretion.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community moderators are responsible for enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior 
and will take action in response to violations.

Community moderators have the right and responsibility to remove messages and media posted 
by the malicious participant and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Community moderators have the right and responsibility to discuss actions with other moderators 
when the community petitions for revisions.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community moderators will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for a malicious participant:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
offensive or unwelcome in the community or specific channel.

**Consequence**: A public, written warning from community moderators towards the responsible participant.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. The bad actor at risk of being
temporary removed from community space

### 3. Suspension

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of the prior standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban of the participant, between 3 days to 3 months

### 4. Long-term Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of the standards. Demonstrating
the participant can be defined as a bad actor.

**Consequence**: A ban of at most 3 years.
