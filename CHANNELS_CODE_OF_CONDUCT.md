# The Monero Project's Matrix & IRC Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, maintainers, and creators of The Monero Project,
pledge not to act stupidly, inappropriately, or with bad intent against another
member in our Matrix/IRC community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to being a good member in the Matrix/IRC space:

* Empathy and kindness toward other people, most notably newcomers.
* Being respectful of different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Accepting constructive feedback.
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes.
* Respecting each channel's intents.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Sexual-related discussions in primary channels or pornography sharing.
* Pattern of trolling and spamming, at which point it disrupt the channel.
* Harassing and/or Insulting another member.
* Doxxing.

Some of these unacceptable behaviors have different severity according to the context 
and channel. Some channels are more lenient or strict than others, and are indicated to members.

More generally, this list of bad behaviors covers the definition of a bad actor, as defined in 
the CONTRIBUTING policy of The Monero Project:

> A bad actor is someone who repeatedly ignores the rules and culture of the project, who is 
needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who is offensive, and who is unable to self-correct their 
behavior when asked to do so by others.

## Community moderators

Community moderators are a set of individuals in the Matrix/IRC community space who have 
moderation capabilities and have engaged themselves to contribute to this end.

- On Matrix, community moderators have the "Moderator" role. They are able to use the 
"banhammer" (or equivalent) bot account to take actions.
- On IRC, community moderators have the "+o" (Owner) mode. They are able to use several 
IRC commands to take actions. Be aware, not all Owners +o members are community moderators.

### Becoming a moderator or Removing a moderator

The group of moderators is managed by itself. New moderators are added at the existing 
moderators' discretion. Existing moderators can be removed, if pleaded by the community, 
at the moderators' discretion.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community moderators are responsible for enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior 
and will take action in response to violations.

Community moderators have the right and responsibility to remove messages and media posted 
by the malicious member and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

Community moderators have the right and responsibility to discuss actions with other moderators 
when the community pleads for revisions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within The Monero Project's Matrix and Libera IRC channels, 
which will be referred to as the Community Spaces in the rest of the document.

### What this document intends to be

This document intends to formalize basic rules so that moderators have easier understanding 
and protection of their role, as well as setting the expectations of the community members 
regarding the general health of the channels.

### What this document does not intend to be

This document **DOES NOT** intend to describe the IRC and Matrix channels as a Safe Space for 
political affiliations or marginalized minorities.

The Monero community is rich, and you'll always find dissident opinions. As long as they 
are respecting the prior rules, they're allowed to be said in the appropriate channels. Online 
political discussions mostly never end well, and members are invited to be more careful 
during such discourse.

## Enforcement Guidelines

the consequences for a malicious member:

offensive or unwelcome in the community or specific channel.
